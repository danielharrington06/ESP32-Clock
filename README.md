# Engineering Challenges: Challenge 1

## ESP32 Clock Project

Code for a LilyGo T-Display ESP32 clock project that connects to an NTP server to sync time and displays both a digital and analogue clock.

I used example code from the Arduino IDE and used the WiFi manager to avoid storing plaintext passwords.
